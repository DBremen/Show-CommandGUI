# Show-CommandGUI
This is module is a function to build a GUI to provide parameter values for a command on the fly and populate default values. It now supports Dynamic Parameters as well.

This code depends on several functions from the module ShowUI ([github](https://github.com/ShowUI/ShowUI))([PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ShowUI/1.5))

There is a known current bug causing the Run button to remain grayed out if none of the parameters of a command are Mandatory.
